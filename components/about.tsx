            <p>
              I specialize in building high-performance Android and iOS applications using Kotlin, Swift, and Flutter.
              With a focus on optimizing app performance and reducing development cycles, I've led teams to deliver
              seamless user experiences across platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              While my primary focus is mobile development, I also bring backend expertise, leveraging Node.js and
              NestJS to ensure robust, scalable infrastructures that support modern mobile applications. I'm known for
              mentoring developers, implementing clean architectures like MVVM, and driving innovation in fast-paced,
              agile environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about creating intuitive, efficient applications that solve real-world problems and provide
              exceptional user experiences.
